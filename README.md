# 30 Day Chart Challenge

My visualizations based on **30DCC**. This is my first year participating on this challenge and I feel so happy with the plots I have already made. I decided my plots on 30DCC of 2024 have an unofficial theme specifically with Greece and some other topics that I am concerned about.

I hope to like my visualizations. In such a I would appreciate if yoy can star my repository, as it gives my motive to go on my journey with R.
